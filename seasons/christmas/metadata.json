  "description": "Atlantis World has always been about collaboration. Through the cold and dark times, weâ€™ve made it through altogether. As we move forward, seasons change. The world around us changes - one step at a time, one pixel at a time. We build that future together - as we move, grow, and stay true to our vision - building a truly decentralized, community-owned, unstoppable metaverse we all deserve. Happy Holidays, Atlantean!",
